# ``polygraphx``: An interface between ``brightway2`` and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)

This is a Python package that provides an interface between the
[`brightway2`](https://brightway.dev) LCA framework and the [`D3.js`](https://d3js.org) JavaScript library.
It is designed to be used in Jupyter notebooks, and provides
interactive visualizations of LCA results.

This interface relies to some extent on [``d3blocks``](https://github.com/d3blocks/d3blocks), a Python package developed
by [Erdogan Taskesen](https://github.com/erdogant).

With ``polygraphx``, the following visualizations are possible:
* Interactive Sankey diagrams
* Force-directed graphs
* Chord diagrams
* Matrix-based heatmaps
* Bi-variate scatterplots
* Violin plots

## Installation

Install ``polygraphx`` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install polyviz
```
